# Use ChatGPT to write function
To help you write code, please provide ChatGPT with the following information:

1. What programming language are you using?
2. What is the specific task you want to accomplish?
3. Do you have any existing code that you have tried? If so, please share it with me.
4. Do you have any specific requirements or constraints that ChatGPT should be aware of?
5. Any additional information or context that may be relevant.
Once ChatGPT has this information, it can assist you in writing the code you need.

## Example
