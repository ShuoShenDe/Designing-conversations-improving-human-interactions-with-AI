# 👾 Designing Conversations: Improving Human Interactions with AI
Welcome to the "Designing conversations: improving human interactions with AI" repository! This repository contains example resources for improving human interactions with AI through designing effective prompt.

## Overview
AI systems are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, from chatbots that help us with customer service inquiries to voice assistants that help us with tasks around the house, from Dall-2 that help us with generating pictures to ChatGPT that assist us with responsing human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt. As these systems become more prevalent, it is essential that they are designed in a way that facilitates effective and meaningful conversations or prompts between humans and machines.

This repository provides resources and guidance for designing conversations that improve human interactions with AI. The resources in this repository include:

- Articles and research papers on conversation design and AI
- Code examples and tutorials for building conversational interfaces
- Best practices for designing effective prompts with AI
- Public resources for AI models and prompts
- Case studies and examples of successful conversational AI implementations

## Getting Started
To get started with designing effective conversations with AI, you can explore the resources in this repository. Start by reading through the articles and research papers to gain a deeper understanding of conversation design principles and best practices.

You can also explore the code examples and tutorials to get hands-on experience with building conversational interfaces. The tools and frameworks provided in this repository can help you streamline your design process and test your conversational AI systems.
