### üååOverview
AI systems are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, from chatbots that help us with customer service inquiries to voice assistants that help us with tasks around the house, from Dall-2 that help us with generating pictures to ChatGPT that assist us with responsing human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt. As these systems become more prevalent, it is essential that they are designed in a way that facilitates effective and meaningful conversations or prompts between humans and machines.

This repository provides resources and guidance for designing conversations that improve human interactions with AI. The resources in this repository include:

- Articles and research papers on conversation design and AI
- Code examples and tutorials for building conversational interfaces
- Best practices for designing effective prompts with AI
- Public resources for AI models and prompts
- Case studies and examples of successful conversational AI implementations

### ‚ö°Getting Started
To get started with designing effective conversations with AI, you can explore the resources in this repository. Start by reading through the articles and research papers to gain a deeper understanding of conversation design principles and best practices.

You can also explore the code examples and tutorials to get hands-on experience with building conversational interfaces. The tools and frameworks provided in this repository can help you streamline your design process and test your conversational AI systems.

### ‚ô®Ô∏è Why prompts are important
In many ways, prompt engineering is like you as a human having a conversation with a machine. Like in the real world, when working with others, good communication skills can help you get things done faster and better; effective prompt engineering can help you achieve better results when communicating with an LLM.

For example as follows, this first prompt is too vague and does not provide any specific information or guidance for ChatGPT to generate a unique and compelling poem about nature. It can result in a generic or clich√©d poem that does not stand out. The second is better.

## Models and Examples:
---

- ### [üëçChatGPT](./ChatGPT/readme.md)
>  A large language model developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It has a diverse range of capabilities, including natural language processing, language translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and more. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from answering trivia questions and providing personalized recommendations to conducting research and generating creative writing [[1]](#1). You can find more [chatGPT Case here](./ChatGPT/readme.md). ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ChatGPT-prompts-green).

- ### [ü§ñ Midjourney](./Midjourney/prompts.md)
> Midjourney is an artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by a San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. You can find more [Midjourney Case here](./Midjourney/prompts.md). ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Midjourney-prompts-blue)

- ### üé•[AI server for video](https://knx30z1z2z.feishu.cn/docx/RLLodJdOjoB1KFxZGjDcPlSInKe)
> This article compiled a list of various AI servers that are capable of generating videos from text inputs. These servers utilize natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) algorithms to analyze and interpret the text and then generate corresponding visual content in the form of videos. 

- ### [üìòDALL-E2](./DALL-E2/readme.md)
> an advanced version of DALL-E. It uses a combination of deep learning algorithms, including Transformers and GANs, to generate images that match the given text description.
The potential applications of DALL-E 2 are vast, including creating realistic product images for e-commerce websites, generating visual aids for scientific research, and even creating art and design elements for various projects [[2]](#2) . You can find more [DALL-E2 Case here](./DALL-E2/readme.md).![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DALL--E2-prompts-yellowgreen).

- ### [üí° Stable Duffusion](./Stable%20Duffusion/readme.md)
> a probabilistic generative model for image and video generation, developed by researchers at Google AI. 
The Stable Diffusion Model is particularly well-suited for generating large images or long videos, and is capable of capturing complex dependencies between the different elements in the image or video. It has been shown to outperform other state-of-the-art generative models in terms of visual quality and diversity [[3]](#3). You can find more [Stable Duffusion Case here](./Stable%20Duffusion/readme.md).![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stable%20Diffusion-prompts-yellowgreen).

- ### [ü•á PaLM-E](./PaLM-E/readme.md) 
> PaLM-E (Pre-training and Language Model for English) is a large-scale language model developed by the research team at Facebook AI. 
The model has potential applications in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and machine translation [[4]](#4). You can find more [PaLM-E Case here](./PaLM-E/readme.md). ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PaLM--E-prompts-yellowgreen).

- ### [üîÆ GPT4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4)
> a large multimodal model (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that, while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks [[5]](#5). You can find more [GPT4 Case here](./DALL-E2/readme.md). ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GPT4-prompts-red). 



We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using AI models!
